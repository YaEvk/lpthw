	#Convert this while loop to a function that you can call, and replace 6 in the test (i < 6) with a variable.
	#Now use this function to rewrite the script to try different numbers.
	#Add another variable to the function arguments that you can pass in that lets you change the + 1 on line 8 so you can change how much it increments by.
	#Rewrite the script again to use this function to see what effect that has.
	#Now, write it to use for-loops and range instead. Do you need the incrementor in the middle anymore? What happens if you do not get rid of it?
